## Call for Participation {#call}


The State of the Map (SotM) conference is the annual OpenStreetMap (OSM) conference run by the [OpenStreetMap Foundation (OSMF)](https://osmfoundation.org/). It is organised by the [SotM Working Group](https://osmfoundation.org/wiki/StateoftheMap_Organizing_Committee), a team of volunteers. SotM 2026 will be held in Paris, France!


State of the Map is intended as an opportunity for the OpenStreetMap community to get to know each other, both personally and regarding their work in OpenStreetMap. We want to offer a programme that covers all topics relevant to OpenStreetMap. Sharing OpenStreetMap knowledge is the essence of SotM. Apart from presentations, we value the interaction between attendees and speakers, so we want to create an environment that boosts creative, critical and healthy discussions, including contentious topics. This year we meet in the beautiful city of Paris in France. We hope that many of you can join us there.

We would love to see your submission for one or more of these tracks:

* OSM Basics
* Community and Foundation
* Mapping
* Cartography
* Software Development
* Data Analysis & Data Model
* User Experiences
* Education

## Tracks {#tracks}

Don’t worry too much about the track categories. They are mainly there to give you an idea on what kind of talks we are looking for and to help us organise the conference. If you find it difficult to select the right track for your talk, choose the one that fits best.

### OSM Basics {#track-basics}
{: .trackicon}

OSM has grown a lot. Many newcomers or "newbies" have a great thirst for knowledge in areas that may seem uninteresting and basic to experienced contributors. We want you, the expert, to pass on your knowledge to the next generation of community members. Considering we have a variety of participants from across the globe, these talks should be easy to follow and understand. Please note the approximate level of previous knowledge that is required for the participants in your submission.

Examples for this kind of talk are: Explaining the OSM data model. Introduction to OSM Editors or cartography tools. Working with OSM data using the Overpass API. How to render a map? How to print a map?

### Community and Foundation {#track-community}
{: .trackicon}

Want to recount your experiences while building a community? Or talk about the vision of the OSMF? Or maybe discuss the strategy of the Board? Then this is the right track for you. Reflections on community diversity and questions on etiquette are also suitable. Other possible topics include reasons to become an OSMF member, working group experiences, and everything related to the OSMF, the OSM communities and local chapters.

### Mapping {#track-mapping}
{: .trackicon}

This track is all about mapping, surveying, data collection, tagging; tips and reflections on OSM editors, or new editor features; reflections on automated mapping, organised editing and imports.

### Cartography {#track-cartography}
{: .trackicon}

Possible topics can include cartography and data visualisation, rendering raster and vector maps, map styles, CartoCSS, MapLibre, maps with QGIS, printing maps and more. All your ideas on how to create a beautiful, fun, quirky and out-of-this-world map! The track also provides a space to present your artistic and creative projects that use OSM data or themes to create clothing, jewellery, 3D printed objects, engravings, visualizations, computer, mobile or board games, virtual worlds, augmented reality, flyers, postcards, etc.

### Software Development {#track-software}
{: .trackicon}

This track awaits talks by or for developers of applications that make use of OSM data: OSM editors, (vector) tile servers, geocoding, routing, navigation, editor layer indices; tips and tricks with new PostGIS features, or new features of other tools and applications.

### Data Analysis and Data Model {#track-data}
{: .trackicon}

This track is dedicated to the OSM data itself: Analysis of the OSM data quality; reflections about enhancing the data model; or discussing the way the OSM data is accessed through the API. Also submissions about the use of AI with OSM data are welcome in this track.

### User Experiences {#track-experiences}
{: .trackicon}

This track is all about the usage of OSM. Examples are how OSM is used in governments, public transport, humanitarian response, and scientific contexts, among others. You can also present citizen projects that are using OSM data to understand and manage their environment.

### Education {#track-education}
{: .trackicon}

This new track is intended for sessions about the use of OSM in an educational context, like geography courses, using OSM as an educational tool in classrooms, how to use OSM when teaching GIS tools, introducing students to contributing to OSM, etc.

## Submission Types {#submission}

Please note that -- with the exception of workshops -- *there will be no registration for pre-recorded or live online talks* this year. We really want speakers and attendees to be able to directly interact with each other, which works best if speakers are on-site in Paris and in the same time zone where the majority of our attendees will also be.

### Talk (20 minutes) {#submission-talk}

Classic talk of about 20 minutes for the talk itself followed by a short question and answer session. This is the preferred submission type.

### Extended Talk (40 minutes) {#submission-talk}

An extended talk has 40 minutes for the talk and 15 minutes for questions. These are for topics you want to explore in more depth. The same rules as for classic talks apply. You should outline why your talk needs more time.

### Workshop (60–90 minutes) {#submission-workshop}

Workshops are sessions in which the participants are actively involved, for example by following some steps on their own devices. We welcome workshops that cover basic beginner's topics as well as innovative technologies.

Please communicate the equipment that participants need to bring in order to participate in your workshop. Also ensure that your participants shouldn't be told to create an account at a commercial platform or a platform with user tracking. Or if so, communicate that in a clear way in your submission and provide guest accounts for your participants.

Workshops will be held either in-person or virtually, not with a mixed audience. If you want to offer the workshop for both audiences, you are welcome to hold it twice. For virtual workshops, we will provide video conference rooms, but with a limited number of seats to ensure a successful session.

### Panel Discussion (60-90 minutes) {#submission-panel}

Panels are for hot, controversial discussions around the OSM community, mapping and data. Topics may cover for example diversity, legal questions or the future of the data model. You should outline the format on how you intend to organise the discussion and make sure to invite the key players for the discussion. Panels must be held in person with all participants present at the conference. We welcome panels that include the audience. Just keep in mind that questions come from virtual and in-person participants. A designated moderator is therefore strongly recommended.

### Other {#submission-other}

Your submission does not fit into any of these submission types? Please get in touch with the programme committee via email ([program-sotm@openstreetmap.org](mailto:program-sotm@openstreetmap.org)) before the end of the call for participation.


## Spontaneous Sessions {#other-submission}

We plan to provide space for sessions which cannot be submitted in advance. Details will be announced before the conference.

### Lightning Talk {#submission-lightning_talk}

Lightning talks are short 5 minute talks. The sign-up for these in-person lightning talks will be done on-site on a whiteboard.

### Birds of a Feather {#submission-bof}

Birds of a Feather (BOF) sessions are informal, spontaneous discussion rounds centred around a specific topic. The sign-up for these in-person lightning talks will be done on-site on a whiteboard. BOFs will be held in-person only.

### Free Spaces {#submission-free_spaces}

We will try to provide free spaces to meet or just chitchat for working groups, local chapters, local groups, user groups, etc., both on-site and online.

## Submission Recommendations {#recommendations}

Based on our past experience, we have some recommendations for your submission:

* Try to come up with a succinct title for your talk. You can add more details to the abstract and the talk description.
* Avoid copy-pasting of an existing project description. These are often lengthy and don't give a lot of information about the actual contents of your talk.
* Mention what your talk will be about and the topics you plan to cover.
* If your session is actually connected to OpenStreetMap but this isn't obvious, make sure to explain how your talk is related to OSM.
* You're welcome to use generative AI like ChatGPT to improve your abstract or talk description, but you must mention this in the organiser notes of your submission. Please refrain from generating the whole submission or large parts of it using AI. It's fine to use it to improve the wording, the grammar and to avoid spelling errors, or to create a translation of texts you have written yourself in your native language. We do prefer imperfect submissions with a human touch that make us look forward to an exciting and interesting talk. We do not want "perfect" and unnecessarily bloated submissions that all sound the same since they were generated by some tool.


## Rating Criteria {#rating}

In rating submissions, we will apply the following criteria:

* OSM as the subject: A submission where OSM is the main subject or an important ingredient will be rated higher than one that is more generic (e.g. a general talk about GIS software).
* Preference of "open": A submission about open data and open source software will be preferred over one that deals with proprietary data or proprietary software and closed platforms.
* Preference of innovation: A submission about something new, or something not discussed at previous conferences, will be preferred over one that discusses more widely known issues (exception: OSM Basics).
* We will try to avoid accepting too many talks from the same person or members of the same organisation.
* We prefer talks from members of underrepresented groups.
* We value transparency. We expect submitters to disclose affiliations and sponsors of their work.


Sometimes we will make some changes or have suggestions:

* We might ask if several speakers can merge their talks.
* We might also ask if a change of format would be possible (for example, we might suggest the lightning talk format instead of a regular talk when we find there is not enough space in the programme for a complete talk, but it is an interesting subject).

## Language {#language}

The general conference language of the State of the Map is English. All presentations shall thus be held in English. It is an important aspect of the conference that participants can interact with the speakers for questions and discussions. There are some exceptions to this general rule:

 * BOF Sessions: Birds of a Feather sessions may be held in other languages, according to the preferences and needs of their participants.
 * French language track: There will be a special track with talks in French. The submitted abstract and talk description still must be in English in order for the programme committee to be able to select the best submissions for this track based on your authoritative translation.

## Publication {#publication}

Video recordings and slides of the lectures will be published under the [Creative Commons Attribution International 3.0 or later (CC BY 3.0+) license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/). If you use any music or other third party media like photos during your talk, make sure it was published under a compatible license, as we might otherwise not be able to publish the video recording of your session.

## Tickets {#conference-tickets}

State of the Map is a non-commercial event where neither the organisers nor the speakers are being paid. Speakers have to get a conference ticket just like everyone else, as well as organise and pay their trip to the conference and their accommodation themselves. Details about the tickets will be announced later.

## Programme Committee {#committee}

Your submissions will be reviewed by a programme committee consisting of OpenStreetMap community members from various parts of the world.

* Manfred Stock (lead programme committee, mapper, Switzerland)
* Sarah Hoffmann (lead programme committee, developer, Germany)
* Benedicta Ohene (OSM Africa, Ghana/West Africa)
* Christine Karch (chairwoman SotM Working Group, Germany)
* Enock Seth Nyamador (mapper, Ghana and Germany)
* Feye Andal (OSM Philippines)
* Laura Mugeha (Kenya)
* Michael Montani (UN Mappers, Italy)
* Minh Nguyễn (EWG, USA)
* Richard Fairhurst (cycle.travel, UK)
* Stefan Keller (Geometa Lab Campus Rapperswil, Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences (FH OST), Switzerland)
* Vincent de Château-Thierry (local team, France)

The programme committee is aware of possible conflict of interest situations. We try to balance that in the composition of the committee. Nevertheless, we have imposed some rules upon ourselves to handle conflict of interest situations:

* We do not rate submissions from our workmates, clients or relatives.
* We act carefully and are aware about possible conflicts (especially the situation of [horse trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_trading)). We act particularly careful in cases associated to a sponsor.
* We communicate to other programme committee members when we are in a conflict of interest situation.
* We report any outside attempt of influencing our decisions to the chair of the SotM Working Group.

We hope this detailed "Call for Presentations" helps to increase the transparency of our programme selection process. Questions are welcome. You can reach us at the following email address: [program-sotm@openstreetmap.org](mailto:program-sotm@openstreetmap.org).
